# liquidity

## Running the project with docker

### Running in production

Prerequisites: `docker`, `docker-compose`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before runnning the project replace all inclusions of testing domain `*.chilipizdrick.xyz`, `liquidity.chilipizdrick.xyz` with your own domain name (in django project settings, nginx settings, etc.)

To run in production environment first make sure to install ssl certificates using certbot:

1. Comment out a section of `./proxy/nginx/conf_prod/nginx.conf` file that looks like this:

```sh
# -- Comment this part out when setuping ssl certs --
# <<<
upstream django_app {
...
...
...
}
# >>>
```

2. Start the project with

```sh
./scripts/start-prod.sh
```

3. Install ssl certs using

```sh
./scripts/setup-ssl.sh
```

4. Uncomment before commented region of `./proxy/nginx/conf_prod/nginx.conf` or use `git stash`

5. Restart the project with

```sh
./scripts/start-prod.sh
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SSL cerificates provided by certbot expire in 3 months, to renew them run `./scripts/renew-ssl.sh` while the production
> environment is running.

### Running in development

```sh
./scripts/start-dev.sh
```

 You may also create superuser for dev environment with
